# PROJECT REBL

**Project Status** ðŸ ® Currently in development | Sprint 4

Political corruption is a widespread and persistent problem in societies around the world. It occurs when elected or appointed officials abuse their power for personal gain or the benefit of their associates or supporters. Corruption can take many forms, including bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, cronyism, and favoritism, among others. The effects of political corruption can be devastating, leading to the misallocation of resources, the erosion of public trust, the undermining of democratic institutions, and the perpetuation of inequality and poverty. As such, combating political corruption remains an ongoing challenge for governments, civil society organizations, and individuals alike.

## Project Overview

Project REBL is a web-based application designed to facilitate the analysis and visualization of social media data related to political corruption. The application utilizes two APIs, namely Reddit and Google Trends, to collect and process data from various social media platforms. By leveraging these APIs, users can gain insights into trending topics, sentiment analysis, and network analysis related to political corruption.  
The team behind this project is composed of four University of Guelph students who plan to continue developing and enhancing the application to better assist users in identifying and combating political corruption.
